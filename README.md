# Introduction

We (names withdrawn for confidentiality reasons) created this website to help high schoolers in our district find matches. We took inspiration from chess and leveraged an [ELO rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to rank students. Users are given two candidates and muse vote for which one they think is hotter. The results determine the ELO change of the candidates. There is a live leaderboard and search functionality to see who is on top right now and to find people easier.
